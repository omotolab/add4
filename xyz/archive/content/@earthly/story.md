## Elija
- 9 years old
- Is introvert and observer. Watches before they speak.
- Is curious from mind and openminded. Yet has inheretet a bit of the skeptisism from it's environment. Has some cognitive dissonance with this way of thinking.
- Observed a lot of skepticism about the world. Doesn't feel like grown-ups will give the proper information and actually talk about what is going on. Everyone just seem to be focussing on dealing with the situation instead of exploring what else is possible. 
- Doens't have that many friends. A kid online, they sometimes talk to. They met a while ago, but that kid moved away, like so many. He was part of a big movers community. Other children of there age are not really into the same topic.
- Elija is playful and sometimes experimental
- Is careful, calm and pays a lot of attention to detail. Likes to observe the changes of live.
- Feels a deep connection to nature and being outside. Most kids play in their VR worlds, yet Elija likes to be offline more then others.
- Elija still has a house that is a bit longer in the family. They still have a shed in the backyard. There grandparents were stayers. Yet it seems like mom it on the fence. She has it in her mind to become one of the movers as well. Trying to sell the house isn't easy. It's not your typical stayers home, with a big bunker. Yet it hasn't been modernized to fit the current weather conditions.
- The back of the shed, is a window, with just enough light to grow the a plant. Elija has discovered the plant.
- Elija just likes the calm. staying aways from the busyness, the pings, the drone zooms. Hiding away after school in the shed. Searching if there is some stuff that might be of benefit to help grow the plant better.


## the world
- There are more factors that are in play, than can be accounted for. That makes it harder to predict the situations.
- There are combinations of extreme weather conditions, which makes it extremely difficult. You can think of extreme heat in combination with moist. Or extreme waterfall, followed by an extreme cold.
- These conditions have really put our psysical limitations to the test. More deceices have come up.
- Technology is focussed on surveilence and short term surviving. What weather is coming up, what combination and how do we balance that out to still have ok conditions. What do we need to adjust in our clothing, or activities?
- Most things are done online, such as school etc.
- The world is more connected, yet divided. Some countries have expended their territory in littiral borders, yet others have expended in mindframe. People are part of a group based on vision and believe, not so much based on location and culture of this location.
- This created two types of lifestyles:
	- the stayers
    - the movers
- the stayers: will have a big bunker, big storages, arms, their tactic is defense. Protect only themselves.
- the movers: don't stay anywhere for to long. A lot of the housing market has moved into this lifestyle. You can rent a type of house, that is always the same, wherever you go. Depending on your subsription you can have first pick to when another weather circumstance is asking people to move around. You don't really buy a house to stay on one place. You just buy a house, to rent it out to movers. Or to have multiple homes. But most people have the moving subsription. As flocks people are migrating, paying for a service to predict where the flock is going to move next.
- Therefore there is a sence of hurry, flux. And not owning to many stuff.
- Most people aren't having children or only one child. Because a lot of people don't want to bring a child into this world. Space and food are scarce and living costs are high. It's not easy when you have to travel either.

"And three two one: we can logout again." Elija sighs relieved. Another schoolday is over. As always, Elija first checks the house to see if anyone is home and if they are offline. Sal is in her VR world taking dance class, so Elija probably won't be bothered for another two hours. Yet this time it feels different. The world feels unreal. And the sounds of the VR game that seep through Sal's headphones seem to only enhance this cloud of fuzz in Elija's mind.

In the back of the garden lies a little shed. Between the maze of old boxes, Elija has created a path to the back of the shed. During the class all Elija could think about going back there again. To check if it was really true. If it was just a dream, or reality. Elija had always been made aware of their own fantastical mind.
