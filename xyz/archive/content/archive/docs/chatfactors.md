Chat Factors

    The weighting of the elements in the chat framework model can change depending on:

        The context of the enquiry, whether Information or Service seeking 

            "How much do I need to pay?
            
                Information seeking

            "Can I get help applying for this?
            
                Service seeking 

    The complexity of the enquiry, whether there is assistance required beyond the "general" scope of the session, commonly requiring "specialised human intervention" 

            "Am I able to apply for this?"
            
                General
        
            "I'll need to put you in touch with a specialist to look at those details" 
            
                Specialised Human Intervention

    Security and sensitivity of the enquiry, whether security process and permissions allow the enquiry to be completed following intstructions, or require "specialised human intervention" due to personal detail access permissions

            "I'm logged in already, can you tell me how to open a new account?"
            
                General enquiry where client has required permissions to complete this enquiry with instruction

            "I think my account is blocked, how do I unblock it?"
            
                Security senstitive, requiring specialised human intervention due to permissions

    Urgency of the enquiry, requiring a very subjective approach and adaption 

            "I'm at the store and my card isn't working, help!!!"
            
                An emergency commonly allows for loosening of the chat model and elements, to accommodate for the emotional response attached to an emergency, as often the benefit of getting straight to the solution whilst skipping "platitudes" acknowledges the immediate need, whilst still leaving room for platitudes in the post solution euphoria 

            "I need to get a loan quickly, help me get approval"
            
                Urgency and emergency are quite subjective, it is important to gather enough information with probing as quickly as possible to assess the real urgency, in order to preposition accordingly
