ChatBot: Hi, I'm Automotola from the Bank of Asgard, can I start with your name please?

Customer: Simon

ChatBot: How can I assist you today Simon?

Customer: I'm looking for a loan

ChatBot: I can definitely assist you with your loan enquiry today. Was the loan for something specific? 

Customer: Yes a house

ChatBot: Certainly! I can check your eligibility for a home loan first, then direct you to an application or put you in touch with a lender.

        No connection using the insight of the loan for a house, this is crucial for the first impression and future expectations of service and assistance. 

        There is a level of prepositioning which presents the desired outcomes of the session, however there is no confirmation or agreement to work towards these outcomes together

        The session is being framed as very basic, as the ChatBot has presented itself as a relatively low-level authority/expert with basic capabilities

        This instance of ChatBot would more likely be a automated filter for for higher security/sensitivty enquiries and higher sales conversion 

        Higher the value and complexity, higher the human involvement needed 

ChatBot: To be eligible for a home loan, you need to be 1) at least 18 years old 2) a citizen of Asgard 3) have at least a 10 percent of the price of the home saved for a deposit

        No confirmation  

Chatbot: Do you meet these requirements Simon?

Customer: Yes

ChatBot: You can start an application to see how much you are eligible to borrow. Please click <here> 

ChatBot: I'll be here if you have any questions.

Customer: Cool thanks
