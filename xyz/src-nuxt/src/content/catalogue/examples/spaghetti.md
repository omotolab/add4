# Spaghetti

Once upon a time there was a little girl who lived in a big house with her mom and dad. Her mom was a teacher and her dad was a doctor. They had a dog named Spot and a cat named Fluffy.

One day, the little girl was playing outside with her dog and cat.

Then, her mom called her inside.

"Come on, honey," she said. "It's time for dinner."

"Okay," said the little girl.

She went inside and sat down at the table.

Her mom and dad were already there.

"What's for dinner?" asked the little girl.

"We're having spaghetti," said her mom.

"I want spaghetti," said the little girl.

"You can have spaghetti," said her dad.

"I want spaghetti," said the little girl.

"You can have spaghetti," said her mom.

"I want spaghetti," said the little girl.
