            Agent: Hi, you're chatting with Simon from the Bank of Asgard, can I start with your name please?

            Customer: Omotola

            Agent: Thank you Omotola. How can I assist you today?

            Customer: I'm looking to get a loan

            Agent: Certainly! So I can assist you as best as possible, was the loan for something in particular? 

            Customer: For a new house

            Agent: Congratulations Omotola that's exciting news! I'd be more than happy to make this process as smooth as possible for you. 

            Agent: What I can do is first check your eligibility to apply for a home loan, then take you through the options and assist you with an application. How does that sound?

            Customer: sounds good, let's do it. But I'm not sure about an application though.
