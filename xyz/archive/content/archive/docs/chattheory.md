Chat Framework Theory

    At present, there are two distinct directions taken by organisations when approaching customer service automation and digital live assistance, specifically with the use of chatbots and multi-channel communication systems. 

        The Human direction involves the use of Chat Systems with a Human operator or Chat Agent to:

            -  create a more efficient and accessible channel for information and assistance 

            - collect feedback regarding service, products and sentiment on the relationship between the company and customers

            - identify opportunities for lead generation, sales conversion and insights for service which goes that "extra step"

        The Bot direction involves the use of Chat Systems without a human operator or Chat Agent to:

            - automate the "frequently asked questions" 

            - give very quick responses to routine information

            - filter enquiries and reduce pressure on other customer service channels e.g. ChatBot may only organise a call from a Specialist if the enquiry has been filtered to a specific issue which is beyond the technical and security capabilities of the ChatBot 

        Depending on the industry, the Human or Bot Direction is taken first, then commonly scaled up towards a blend of:

        - Initial ChatBot answering FAQ and filtering enquiries
        - Specific products and services enquiries being filtered to the Chat Agent for further processing and security access 

        The specific mix heavily depends on the channel which is being used (whether browser chat, mobile), the security level of the enquiry and the capabilities of the customer service environment.
