## About

The IPCC Raport of 2021 was 3947 pages, excluding references. Therefore we do not need to say that there is a lack of information. Yet we know that most people don't have the time and patience to read this heavy document completely, on their sunday morning. What if this information was processed in a way that anyone could learn about the content by visualisations and interesting storytelling?

Earthly.ai is currently being developed to decrease the gap of knowledge from research to implementation and understanding in the general public.
