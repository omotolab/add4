Chat  Framework
-

At present, there are two distinct directions taken by organisations when approaching customer service automation and digital live assistance, specifically with the use of chatbots and multi-channel communication systems. 

The Human direction involves the use of Chat Systems with a Human operator or Chat Agent to:

    -  create a more efficient and accessible channel for information and assistance 

    - collect feedback regarding service, products and sentiment on the relationship between the company and customers

    - identify opportunities for lead generation, sales conversion and insights for service which goes that "extra step"

The Bot direction involves the use of Chat Systems without a human operator or Chat Agent to:

- automate the "frequently asked questions" 

- give very quick responses to routine information

- filter enquiries and reduce pressure on other customer service channels e.g. ChatBot may only organise a call from a Specialist if the enquiry has been filtered to a specific issue which is beyond the technical and security capabilities of the ChatBot 

Depending on the industry, the Human or Bot Direction is taken first, then commonly scaled up towards a blend of:

- Initial ChatBot answering FAQ and filtering enquiries
- Specific products and services enquiries being filtered to the Chat Agent for further processing and security access 

The specific mix heavily depends on the channel which is being used (whether browser chat, mobile), the security level of the enquiry and the capabilities of the customer service environment. 

Example

*this chat is beginning* 

ChatBot: Hi, I'm Automotola from the Bank of Asgard, can I start with your name please?

Customer: Simon

ChatBot: How can I assist you today Simon?

Customer: I'm looking for a loan

ChatBot: I can definitely assist you with your loan enquiry today. Was the loan for something specific? 

Customer: Yes a house

    ChatBot: Certainly! I can check your eligibility for a home loan first, then direct you to an application or put you in touch with a lender.

        // No connection using the insight of the loan for a house, this is crucial for the first impression and future expectations of service and assistance. 

        // There is a level of prepositioning which presents the desired outcomes of the session, however there is no confirmation or agreement to work towards these outcomes together

        // The session is being framed as very basic, as the ChatBot has presented itself as a relatively low-level authority/expert with basic capabilities

        // This instance of ChatBot would more likely be a automated filter for for higher security/sensitivty enquiries and higher sales conversion 

        // Higher the value and complexity, higher the human involvement needed 

ChatBot: To be eligible for a home loan, you need to be 1) at least 18 years old 2) a citizen of Asgard 3) have at least a 10 percent of the price of the home saved for a deposit

// No confirmation  

Chatbot: Do you meet these requirements Simon?

Customer: Yes

ChatBot: You can start an application to see how much you are eligible to borrow. Please click <here> 

ChatBot: I'll be here if you have any questions.

Customer: Cool thanks

Customer Service (CBA) 

Agent: Hi, you're chatting with Simon from the Bank of Asgard, can I start with your name please?

Customer: Omotola

Agent: Thank you Omotola. How can I assist you today?

Customer: I'm looking to get a loan

Agent: Certainly! So I can assist you as best as possible, was the loan for something in particular? 

// so I can point you in the right direction - less rigid and botlike 

Customer: For a new house

Agent: Congratulations Omotola that's exciting news! I'd be more than happy to make this process as smooth as possible for you. 

Agent: What I can do is first check your eligibility to apply for a home loan, then take you through the options and assist you with an application. How does that sound?

Customer: sounds good, let's do it. But I'm not sure about an application though.
