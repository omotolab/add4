Chat Structure Framework
    
    Generally, the structure of a customer service or live assistance chat follow a similar model and elements:

        - Introduction
        - Connection 
        - Prepositioning
        - Probing
        - Processing
        - Confirmation

    These elements do not have to follow a strict linear progression, however for the completeness of communication, are required. 

        Introduction

            - the interaction is framed
            - the overall character is developed and presented (first impression) 
            - expectations are set, for the present and future interactions

                Traditional Style  

                    "hi, I'm Simon from the Bank of Asgard, how can I assist you today?"
                    "you're chatting with Simon today, can I start with your name please?"

                Towards Turing Style 

                    "how are you doing this morning?"
                    "how's your work going so far? 
                    "how's your morning been so far?"
                    "what's on your mind?"
                    "what are you getting up to today?

        Connection

            - develop a point of relation to humanise the enquiry
            - establish a trusting relationship based on data sensitivity and security
            - frame enquiries and interventions from adverserial to cooperative 

                Traditional Style

                    "I can certainly assist you with your enquiry today"

                Towards Turing Style

                    "always good to get ahead of schedule"

                    "banking can be tough/time consuming/tedious, but we have a plan"  // adjust and develop vocabulary progressively, frame in terms of value adding or waste saving

                    "let's see what we can do about x"

                    "lets take a look at x"

                    "can we take a look at x now?"

        Prepositioning

            - Maximise information gathered
            - Return proposed critical path
            - Minimise steps in interaction and effort

                Traditional Style 
                    
                Towards Turing Style 
                    "what we can do is X, Y or Z"

                    "what I first show you is how to X, then we can X"

                    "Once we finish X, I can help you with Y. It will only take 10 minutes."

                    "We need to do X before Y, which will take 20 minutes. We can get started now?"

        Probing

            - Consecutive questions and/or statements which guide the interaction/intervention

            - Highlight the neccessary next steps with minimal data

            - Gather insight into conclusive actions (last steps before the task is finished)

            - Highlight any additional information post-fact

                Traditional Style

                Towards Turing Style 

                "now that we've taken care of X, it may be a good idea to look at Y now and be prepared"

                "once X is finished, we can start on Y as you'll need that for Z"

        Processing

            - Reassurance between steps
            - Ensuring a conversational flow is maintained

            - Minimising conversational "rabbit holes"
