# Process & Projects

This represent an event that you have either created,
participated in, or observed. Events can be created in
accounts that you own, or in archives that you have been
invited to. You will not be able to delete then in other
archives. 

Events that you can observe are also initiated through
invitations. However, you will only have a 'viewer' mode
permit, not an 'editor' mode permit. You will still be 
able to interact within the limits set as default by
the 'author' of the space.
